                  Absentee balloting is allowed under the circumstance that a
                  member can not be present at the meeting. Absentee ballots
                  must be submitted in a sealed envelope, signed across the

                  Results will be validated by a majority vote. In the case that
                  no candidate achieves a majority, the candidate who received
                  the least votes, determined by random lot administered by the
                  DRO if there is a tie, shall be stricken from the ballot. The
                  position shall be voted for again. This procedure shall
                  continue until a majority is reached or, if a tie occurs with
                  only two candidates remaining, the winner shall be determined
                  by a random lot administered by the DRO.

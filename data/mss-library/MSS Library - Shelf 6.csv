9789350334980,Beyond Good & Evil,1,"Friedrich Nietzsche was an influential German philosopher whose works have been considered a source of inspiration for writers in the fields of psychology, philosophy, theology and literature. Beyond Good and Evil is an attempt by the renowned scholar to depict the frailty of the moral concepts adhered by the old philosophers. Through this groundbreaking work, Nietzsche inspires the philosophers of the future to be men of experiments. He advises them to celebrate the creative aspect of truth that appeals to the self and become critics rather than skeptics. The book is divided into 9 sections that include 296 aphorisms. Written in a critical and witty style, the novel throws light upon the diverse aspects of the modern world that include religion, morality, free spirit, power of the will, virtues and nobility.",Friedrich Nietzsche,Maple Press Pvt Limited,2019-09-25,,English,Unknown,2024-06-24T14:04:10-06:00,
9789388810968,Thus Spoke Zarathustra,1,"Many lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples: no greater power did Zarathustra find on earth than the creations of the loving ones-- "" good"" and "" bad"" are their names.' After spending a decade in a cave on the mountains, the prophet Zarathustra comes down and begins talking to people. He believes that God is dead, and preaches about the Superman who has surpassed the notions of good and evil and embraced the idea of eternal recurrence. Reflecting on the Nietzschean philosophy, Zarathustra's sermons and discourses expound the concepts of will to power, the Ü bermensch (Superman), eternal return, radical perspectivism, problem of nihilism, and individualism among others. One of the most influential and popular works of Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra was an inspiration for many. Intense and insightful, this philosophical novel remains a literary masterpiece.""",Friedrich Nietzsche,Fingerprint! Publishing,2019-01-04,,English,Unknown,2024-06-24T14:04:18-06:00,

9781594632334,How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia,1,"""Mr. Hamid reaffirms his place as one of his generation's most inventive and gifted writers."" –Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times ""A globalized version of The Great Gatsby . . . [Hamid's] book is nearly that good."" –Alan Cheuse, NPR ""Marvelous and moving."" –TIME Magazine From the internationally bestselling author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist and Exit West, the boldly imagined tale of a poor boy’s quest for wealth and love His first two novels established Mohsin Hamid as a radically inventive storyteller with his finger on the world’s pulse. How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia meets that reputation—and exceeds it. The astonishing and riveting tale of a man’s journey from impoverished rural boy to corporate tycoon, it steals its shape from the business self-help books devoured by ambitious youths all over “rising Asia.” It follows its nameless hero to the sprawling metropolis where he begins to amass an empire built on that most fluid, and increasingly scarce, of goods: water. Yet his heart remains set on something else, on the pretty girl whose star rises along with his, their paths crossing and recrossing, a lifelong affair sparked and snuffed and sparked again by the forces that careen their fates along. How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia is a striking slice of contemporary life at a time of crushing upheaval. Romantic without being sentimental, political without being didactic, and spiritual without being religious, it brings an unflinching gaze to the violence and hope it depicts. And it creates two unforgettable characters who find moments of transcendent intimacy in the midst of shattering change.",Mohsin Hamid,Penguin,2014-03-04,242,English,Unknown,2024-06-24T14:04:52-06:00,

9780321587992,Thomas' Calculus,1,"This text is designed for a three-semester or four-quarter calculus course (math, engineering, and science majors). Calculus hasn't changed, but your students have. Today's students have been raised on immediacy and the desire for relevance, and they come to calculus with varied mathematical backgrounds. Thomas' Calculus, Twelfth Edition, helps your students successfully generalize and apply the key ideas of calculus through clear and precise explanations, clean design, thoughtfully chosen examples, and superior exercise sets. Thomas offers the right mix of basic, conceptual, and challenging exercises, along with meaningful applications. This significant revision features more examples, more mid-level exercises, more figures, and improved conceptual flow. This is the complete text, which contains Chapters 1-16. Separate versions are available, covering just Single Variable topics (contains Chapters 1-11 and Multivariable topics (contains Chapters 11-16).

9780691161907,Zombies & Calculus,1,"""If you're dying to read a novel treatment of calculus, then you should run (don't walk!) to buy Zombies and Calculus by Colin Adams. You'll see calculus come alive in a way that could save your life someday.""--Arthur Benjamin, Harvey Mudd College ""Before Zombies and Calculus, math was quick to kill my appetite. In fact, math damn near killed me altogether throughout most of college (it is of course a cliche to say that as a math student I was pretty much a zombie). If I had only had this book then . . . at least now I can stomach derivatives as well as a zombie outbreak. That's no small accomplishment! Read Zombies and Calculus--you'll laugh . . . you'll cry . . . you'll multiply.""--Steven C. Schlozman, M.D., author of The Zombie Autopsies ""Using a fictional, tongue-in-cheek account of an outbreak of a zombie virus at a small liberal arts college, Adams discusses mathematical subjects such as the spread of a disease in a population, differential equations, and tangent vectors. He succeeds in conveying the idea that calculus is useful in numerous aspects of life--including surviving a zombie apocalypse. The book is one of a kind.""--Joel Hass, University of California, Davis ""Zombies and Calculus shows how calculus can be used to understand many different real-world phenomena, from population growth to Newton's law of cooling. The fast-paced narrative propels readers forward, and Adams's style is humorous and compelling. I laughed out loud, in public, several times while reading this book. I had a hard time putting it down.""--Amy N. Myers, Bryn Mawr College ""Zombies and Calculus is unlike just about anything I've ever read. It is both an introduction to assorted math concepts and an action-packed adventure story about escaping a zombie invasion. It's also laugh-out-loud funny in many places.""--Meredith L.

9780534251581,Calculus,1,"In this version of his best-selling text, Stewart has reorganized the material so professors can teach transcendental functions (more than just trigonometric functions) early, before the definite integral. This variation introduces the derivative of the log and exponential functions at the same time as the polynomial functions and develops other transcendental functions prior to the introduction of the definite integral..In the new Third Edition, Stewart retains the focus on problem solving, the meticulous accuracy, the patient explanations, and the carefully graded problems that have made this text work so well for a wide range of students. In the new edition, Stewart has increased his emphasis on technology and innovation and has expanded his focus on problem-solving and applications. ..When writing his previous editions, Stewart set out to bring some of the spirit of Polya to his presentation. This resulted in the ''strategy sections'' in the First Edition and the ''Problems Plus'' and ''Applications Plus'' sections in the Second Edition. Now in the Third Edition, he extends the idea further with a new section on ''Principles of Problem Solving'' and new extended examples in the ''Problems Plus'' and ''Applications Plus'' sections.

9780821851937,Differential Topology,1,"Differential Topology provides an elementary and intuitive introduction to the study of smooth manifolds. In the years since its first publication, Guillemin and Pollack's book has become a standard text on the subject. It is a jewel of mathematical exposition, judiciously picking exactly the right mixture of detail and generality to display the richness within. The text is mostly self-contained, requiring only undergraduate analysis and linear algebra. By relying on a unifying idea--transversality--the authors are able to avoid the use of big machinery or ad hoc techniques to establish the main results. In this way, they present intelligent treatments of important theorems, such as the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, the PoincarÃ©-Hopf index theorem, and Stokes theorem. The book has a wealth of exercises of various types. Some are routine explorations of the main material. In others, the students are guided step-by-step through proofs of fundamental results, such as the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem. An exercise section in Chapter 4 leads the student through a construction of de Rham cohomology and a proof of its homotopy invariance. The book is suitable for either an introductory graduate course or an advanced undergraduate course.","Victor Guillemin, Alan Pollack",American Mathematical Soc.,2010-01-01,242,English,Unknown,2024-06-20T15:19:15-06:00

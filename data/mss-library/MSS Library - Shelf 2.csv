9780471682998,Visual Linear Algebra,1,"Following an innovative approach to learning, this text integrates paper and pencil skill building and the theoretical development of ideas with geometric exploration and conceptual understanding. Tutorials and traditional text. Visual Linear Algebra covers the topics in a standard one-semester introductory linear algebra course in forty-seven sections arranged in eight chapters. In each chapter, some sections are written in a traditional textbook style and some are tutorials designed to be worked through using either Maple or Mathematica. About the tutorials Each tutorial is a self-contained treatment of a core topic or application of linear algebra that a student can work through with minimal assistance from an instructor. The thirty tutorials are provided on the accompanying CD both as Maple worksheets and as Mathematica notebooks. They also appear in print as sections of the textbook. Geometry is used extensively to help students develop their intuition about the concepts of linear algebra. Applications. Students benefit greatly from working through an application, if the application captures their interest and the materials give them substantial activities that yield worthwhile results. Ten carefully selected applications have been developed and an entire tutorial is devoted to each of them. Active Learning. To encourage students to be active learners, the tutorials have been designed to engage and retain their interest. The exercises, demonstrations, explorations, visualizations, and animations are designed to stimulate students??? interest, encourage them to think clearly about the mathematics they are working through, and help them check their comprehension.","Eugene A.

9780321287137,Linear Algebra and Its Applications,1,"Linear algebra is relatively easy for students during the early stages of the course, when the material is presented in a familiar, concrete setting. But when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a brick wall. Instructors seem to agree that certain concepts (such as linear independence, spanning, subspace, vector space, and linear transformations), are not easily understood, and require time to assimilate. Since they are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, students' understanding of these concepts is vital to their mastery of the subject. Lay introduces these concepts early in a familiar, concrete Rn setting, develops them gradually, and returns to them again and again throughout the text so that when discussed in the abstract, these concepts are more accessible.",David C.

Discrete and Computational Geometry offers a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to this cutting-edge frontier of mathematics and computer science. This book covers traditional topics such as convex hulls, triangulations, and Voronoi diagrams, as well as more recent subjects like pseudotriangulations, curve reconstruction, and locked chains. It also touches on more advanced material, including Dehn invariants, associahedra, quasigeodesics, Morse theory, and the recent resolution of the Poincaré conjecture. Connections to real-world applications are made throughout, and algorithms are presented independently of any programming language.

Furthermore, the techniques used to rigorously establish the expansion property of a graph draw from such diverse areas of mathematics as representation theory, algebraic geometry, and arithmetic combinatorics. This text focuses on the latter topic in the important case of Cayley graphs on finite groups of Lie type, developing tools such as Kazhdan's property (T), quasirandomness, product estimates, escape from subvarieties, and the Balog-Szemerédi-Gowers lemma.

Its techniques are used in many areas of mathematics, with applications to physics, engineering, and computer science as well. Author Robert B. Ash, a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Illinois, focuses on intuitive thinking. He also conveys the intrinsic beauty of abstract algebra while keeping the proofs as brief and clear as possible. The early chapters provide students with background by investigating the basic properties of groups, rings, fields, and modules. Later chapters examine the relations between groups and sets, the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, and the results and methods of abstract algebra in terms of algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry, noncommutative algebra, and homological algebra, including categories and functors. An extensive supplement to the text delves much further into homological algebra than most introductory texts, offering applications-oriented results.

0-412-23900-0,"Graphs, Surfaces and Homology",1,"viii homology groups. A weaker result, sufficient nevertheless for our purposes, is proved in Chapter 5, where the reader will also find some discussion of the need for a more powerful in variance theorem and a summary of the proof of such a theorem. Secondly the emphasis in this book is on low-dimensional examples the graphs and surfaces of the title since it is there that geometrical intuition has its roots. The goal of the book is the investigation in Chapter 9 of the properties of graphs in surfaces; some of the problems studied there are mentioned briefly in the Introduction, which contains an in formal survey of the material of the book. Many of the results of Chapter 9 do indeed generalize to higher dimensions (and the general machinery of simplicial homology theory is avai1able from earlier chapters) but I have confined myself to one example, namely the theorem that non-orientable closed surfaces do not embed in three-dimensional space. One of the principal results of Chapter 9, a version of Lefschetz duality, certainly generalizes, but for an effective presentation such a gener- ization needs cohomology theory. Apart from a brief mention in connexion with Kirchhoff's laws for an electrical network I do not use any cohomology here.

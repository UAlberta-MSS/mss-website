9780176251796,Modern Statistics,1,"Computers have revolutionized what can be done in statistics and how it can be done, but introductory statistics textbooks have not always kept pace. Maximizing the potential of a computer-enriched, introductory statistics course by acknowledging what the computer can do, Goodman has discarded outdated tables and procedures, introduced when it was assumed calculation could only be done by pen and calculator. Enhancing the content and presentation of traditional methods, Goodman offers a fresh, experiential introduction to statistical concepts and calculations, while providing new possibilities for statistical exploration and experience. The goal of Modern Statistics is to take full advantage of the computer resources now available to students of statistics, fully integrating the coverage of the statistics curriculum with the related coverage of relevant statistical software. Goodman has thus created a modern approach to statistical methods -- an approach that encourages and promotes critical thinking in the application and interpretation of modern statistical techniques.",William Martin Goodman,,2008-02-08,752,English,Unknown,2024-06-24T12:34:12-06:00,

            This text is designed for a three-semester or four-quarter calculus
            course (math, engineering, and science majors). Calculus hasn't
            changed, but your students have. Today's students have been raised
            on immediacy and the desire for relevance, and they come to calculus
            with varied mathematical backgrounds. Thomas' Calculus, Twelfth
            Edition, helps your students successfully generalize and apply the
            key ideas of calculus through clear and precise explanations, clean
            design, thoughtfully chosen examples, and superior exercise sets.
            Thomas offers the right mix of basic, conceptual, and challenging
            exercises, along with meaningful applications. This significant
            revision features more examples, more mid-level exercises, more
            figures, and improved conceptual flow. This is the complete text,
            which contains Chapters 1-16. Separate versions are available,
            covering just Single Variable topics (contains Chapters 1-11 and
            Multivariable topics (contains Chapters 11-16). MyMathLab access is
            not included with this ISBN.

            "If you're dying to read a novel treatment of calculus, then you
            should run (don't walk!) to buy Zombies and Calculus by Colin Adams.
            You'll see calculus come alive in a way that could save your life
            someday."--Arthur Benjamin, Harvey Mudd College "Before Zombies and
            Calculus, math was quick to kill my appetite. In fact, math damn
            near killed me altogether throughout most of college (it is of
            course a cliche to say that as a math student I was pretty much a
            zombie). If I had only had this book then . . . at least now I can
            stomach derivatives as well as a zombie outbreak. That's no small
            accomplishment! Read Zombies and Calculus--you'll laugh . . . you'll
            cry . . . you'll multiply."--Steven C. Schlozman, M.D., author of
            The Zombie Autopsies "Using a fictional, tongue-in-cheek account of
            an outbreak of a zombie virus at a small liberal arts college, Adams
            discusses mathematical subjects such as the spread of a disease in a
            population, differential equations, and tangent vectors. He succeeds
            in conveying the idea that calculus is useful in numerous aspects of
            life--including surviving a zombie apocalypse. The book is one of a
            kind."--Joel Hass, University of California, Davis "Zombies and
            Calculus shows how calculus can be used to understand many different
            real-world phenomena, from population growth to Newton's law of
            cooling. The fast-paced narrative propels readers forward, and
            Adams's style is humorous and compelling. I laughed out loud, in
            public, several times while reading this book. I had a hard time
            putting it down."--Amy N. Myers, Bryn Mawr College "Zombies and
            Calculus is unlike just about anything I've ever read. It is both an
            introduction to assorted math concepts and an action-packed
            adventure story about escaping a zombie invasion. It's also
            laugh-out-loud funny in many places."--Meredith L. Greer, Bates

            In this version of his best-selling text, Stewart has reorganized
            the material so professors can teach transcendental functions (more
            than just trigonometric functions) early, before the definite
            integral. This variation introduces the derivative of the log and
            exponential functions at the same time as the polynomial functions
            and develops other transcendental functions prior to the
            introduction of the definite integral..In the new Third Edition,
            Stewart retains the focus on problem solving, the meticulous
            accuracy, the patient explanations, and the carefully graded
            problems that have made this text work so well for a wide range of
            students. In the new edition, Stewart has increased his emphasis on
            technology and innovation and has expanded his focus on
            problem-solving and applications. ..When writing his previous
            editions, Stewart set out to bring some of the spirit of Polya to
            his presentation. This resulted in the ''strategy sections'' in the
            First Edition and the ''Problems Plus'' and ''Applications Plus''
            sections in the Second Edition. Now in the Third Edition, he extends
            the idea further with a new section on ''Principles of Problem
            Solving'' and new extended examples in the ''Problems Plus'' and
            ''Applications Plus'' sections. Stewart makes a serious attempt to
            help students reason mathematically.

            For one- or two-semester junior or senior level courses in Advanced
            Calculus, Analysis I, or Real Analysis. This text prepares students
            for future courses that use analytic ideas, such as real and complex
            analysis, partial and ordinary differential equations, numerical
            analysis, fluid mechanics, and differential geometry. This book is
            designed to challenge advanced students while encouraging and
            helping weaker students. Offering readability, practicality and
            flexibility, Wade presents fundamental theorems and ideas from a
            practical viewpoint, showing students the motivation behind the
            mathematics and enabling them to construct their own proofs.

            This text on complex variables is geared toward graduate students
            and undergraduates who have taken an introductory course in real
            analysis. It is a substantially revised and updated edition of the
            popular text by Robert B. Ash, offering a concise treatment that
            provides careful and complete explanations as well as numerous
            problems and solutions. An introduction presents basic definitions,
            covering topology of the plane, analytic functions,
            real-differentiability and the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and
            exponential and harmonic functions. Succeeding chapters examine the
            elementary theory and the general Cauchy theorem and its
            applications, including singularities, residue theory, the open
            mapping theorem for analytic functions, linear fractional
            transformations, conformal mapping, and analytic mappings of one
            disk to another. The Riemann mapping theorem receives a thorough
            treatment, along with factorization of analytic functions. As an
            application of many of the ideas and results appearing in earlier
            chapters, the text ends with a proof of the prime number theorem.

            Differential Topology provides an elementary and intuitive
            introduction to the study of smooth manifolds. In the years since
            its first publication, Guillemin and Pollack's book has become a
            standard text on the subject. It is a jewel of mathematical
            exposition, judiciously picking exactly the right mixture of detail
            and generality to display the richness within. The text is mostly
            self-contained, requiring only undergraduate analysis and linear
            algebra. By relying on a unifying idea--transversality--the authors
            are able to avoid the use of big machinery or ad hoc techniques to
            establish the main results. In this way, they present intelligent
            treatments of important theorems, such as the Lefschetz fixed-point
            theorem, the Poincar&eacute;-Hopf index theorem, and Stokes theorem.
            The book has a wealth of exercises of various types. Some are
            routine explorations of the main material. In others, the students
            are guided step-by-step through proofs of fundamental results, such
            as the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem. An exercise section in
            Chapter 4 leads the student through a construction of de Rham
            cohomology and a proof of its homotopy invariance. The book is
            suitable for either an introductory graduate course or an advanced
            undergraduate course.

            Following an innovative approach to learning, this text integrates
            paper and pencil skill building and the theoretical development of
            ideas with geometric exploration and conceptual understanding.
            Tutorials and traditional text. Visual Linear Algebra covers the
            topics in a standard one-semester introductory linear algebra course
            in forty-seven sections arranged in eight chapters. In each chapter,
            some sections are written in a traditional textbook style and some
            are tutorials designed to be worked through using either Maple or
            Mathematica. About the tutorials Each tutorial is a self-contained
            treatment of a core topic or application of linear algebra that a
            student can work through with minimal assistance from an instructor.
            The thirty tutorials are provided on the accompanying CD both as
            Maple worksheets and as Mathematica notebooks. They also appear in
            print as sections of the textbook. Geometry is used extensively to
            help students develop their intuition about the concepts of linear
            algebra. Applications. Students benefit greatly from working through

            materials give them substantial activities that yield worthwhile

            The theory of groups is simultaneously a branch of abstract algebra
            and the study of symmetry. Designed for readers approaching the
            subject for the first time, this book reviews all the essentials. It
            recaps the basic definitions and results, including Lagranges
            Theorem, the isomorphism theorems and group actions. Later chapters
            include material on chain conditions and finiteness conditions, free
            groups and the theory of presentations. In addition, a novel chapter
            of "entertainments" demonstrates an assortment of results that can
            be achieved with the theoretical machinery.

            Linear algebra is relatively easy for students during the early
            stages of the course, when the material is presented in a familiar,
            concrete setting. But when abstract concepts are introduced,
            students often hit a brick wall. Instructors seem to agree that
            certain concepts (such as linear independence, spanning, subspace,
            vector space, and linear transformations), are not easily
            understood, and require time to assimilate. Since they are
            fundamental to the study of linear algebra, students' understanding
            of these concepts is vital to their mastery of the subject. Lay
            introduces these concepts early in a familiar, concrete Rn setting,
            develops them gradually, and returns to them again and again
            throughout the text so that when discussed in the abstract, these
            concepts are more accessible.

            This graduate-level text is intended for initial courses in algebra
            that begin with first principles but proceed at a faster pace than
            undergraduate-level courses. It employs presentations and proofs
            that are accessible to students, and it provides numerous concrete
            examples. Exercises appear throughout the text, clarifying concepts
            as they arise; additional exercises, varying widely in difficulty,
            are included at the ends of the chapters. Subjects include groups,
            rings, fields and Galois theory, modules, and structure of rings and
            algebras. Further topics encompass infinite Abelian groups,
            transcendental field extensions, representations and characters of
            finite groups, Galois groups, and additional areas. Based on many
            years of classroom experience, this self-contained treatment
            breathes new life into abstract concepts.

            Discrete geometry is a relatively new development in pure
            mathematics, while computational geometry is an emerging area in
            applications-driven computer science. Their intermingling has
            yielded exciting advances in recent years, yet what has been lacking
            until now is an undergraduate textbook that bridges the gap between
            the two. Discrete and Computational Geometry offers a comprehensive
            yet accessible introduction to this cutting-edge frontier of
            mathematics and computer science. This book covers traditional
            topics such as convex hulls, triangulations, and Voronoi diagrams,
            as well as more recent subjects like pseudotriangulations, curve
            reconstruction, and locked chains. It also touches on more advanced
            material, including Dehn invariants, associahedra, quasigeodesics,
            Morse theory, and the recent resolution of the Poincar&eacute;
            conjecture. Connections to real-world applications are made
            throughout, and algorithms are presented independently of any
            programming language. This richly illustrated textbook also features
            numerous exercises and unsolved problems. The essential introduction
            to discrete and computational geometry Covers traditional topics as
            well as new and advanced material Features numerous full-color

            Expander graphs are an important tool in theoretical computer
            science, geometric group theory, probability, and number theory.
            Furthermore, the techniques used to rigorously establish the
            expansion property of a graph draw from such diverse areas of
            mathematics as representation theory, algebraic geometry, and
            arithmetic combinatorics. This text focuses on the latter topic in
            the important case of Cayley graphs on finite groups of Lie type,
            developing tools such as Kazhdan's property (T), quasirandomness,
            product estimates, escape from subvarieties, and the
            Balog-Szemer&eacute;di-Gowers lemma. Applications to the affine
            sieve of Bourgain, Gamburd, and Sarnak are also given. The material
            is largely self-contained, with additional sections on the general
            theory of expanders, spectral theory, Lie theory, and the Lang-Weil
            bound, as well as numerous exercises and other optional material.

            Geared toward upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, this
            text surveys fundamental algebraic structures and maps between these
            structures. Its techniques are used in many areas of mathematics,
            with applications to physics, engineering, and computer science as
            well. Author Robert B. Ash, a Professor of Mathematics at the
            University of Illinois, focuses on intuitive thinking. He also
            conveys the intrinsic beauty of abstract algebra while keeping the
            proofs as brief and clear as possible. The early chapters provide
            students with background by investigating the basic properties of
            groups, rings, fields, and modules. Later chapters examine the
            relations between groups and sets, the fundamental theorem of Galois
            theory, and the results and methods of abstract algebra in terms of
            algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry, noncommutative algebra,
            and homological algebra, including categories and functors. An
            extensive supplement to the text delves much further into
            homological algebra than most introductory texts, offering
            applications-oriented results. Solutions to all problems appear in
            the text.

            The study of permutations groups has always been closely associated
            with that of highly symmetric structures. The objects considered
            here are countably infinite, but have only finitely many different
            substructures of any given finite size. This book discusses such
            structures, their substructures and their automorphism groups using
            a wide range of techniques.

            Nonclassical logics have played an increasing role in recent years
            in disciplines ranging from mathematics and computer science to
            linguistics and philosophy. Generalized Galois Logics develops a
            uniform framework of relational semantics to mediate between logical
            calculi and their semantics through algebra. This volume addresses
            normal modal logics such as K and S5, and substructural logics,
            including relevance logics, linear logic, and Lambek calculi. The
            authors also treat less-familiar and new logical systems with equal
            deftness.

            The classification theory of algebraic varieties is the focus of
            this book. This very active area of research is still developing,
            but an amazing quantity of knowledge has accumulated over the past
            twenty years. The authors goal is to provide an easily accessible
            introduction to the subject. The book starts with preparatory and
            standard definitions and results, then moves on to discuss various
            aspects of the geometry of smooth projective varieties with many
            rational curves, and finishes in taking the first steps towards
            Moris minimal model program of classification of algebraic varieties
            by proving the cone and contraction theorems. The book is
            well-organized and the author has kept the number of concepts that
            are used but not proved to a minimum to provide a mostly
            self-contained introduction.

            Lie groups and Lie algebras have become essential to many parts of
            mathematics and theoretical physics, with Lie algebras a central
            object of interest in their own right. This book provides an
            elementary introduction to Lie algebras based on a lecture course
            given to fourth-year undergraduates. The only prerequisite is some
            linear algebra and an appendix summarizes the main facts that are
            needed. The treatment is kept as simple as possible with no attempt
            at full generality. Numerous worked examples and exercises are
            provided to test understanding, along with more demanding problems,
            several of which have solutions. Introduction to Lie Algebras covers
            the core material required for almost all other work in Lie theory
            and provides a self-study guide suitable for undergraduate students
            in their final year and graduate students and researchers in
            mathematics and theoretical physics.

            First year graduate algebra text. The choice of topics is guided by
            the underlying theme of modules as a basic unifying concept in
            mathematics. Beginning with standard topics in group and ring
            theory, the authors then develop basic module theory and its use in
            investigating bilinear, sesquilinear, and quadratic forms.

            viii homology groups. A weaker result, sufficient nevertheless for
            our purposes, is proved in Chapter 5, where the reader will also
            find some discussion of the need for a more powerful in variance
            theorem and a summary of the proof of such a theorem. Secondly the
            emphasis in this book is on low-dimensional examples the graphs and
            surfaces of the title since it is there that geometrical intuition
            has its roots. The goal of the book is the investigation in Chapter
            9 of the properties of graphs in surfaces; some of the problems
            studied there are mentioned briefly in the Introduction, which
            contains an in formal survey of the material of the book. Many of
            the results of Chapter 9 do indeed generalize to higher dimensions
            (and the general machinery of simplicial homology theory is
            avai1able from earlier chapters) but I have confined myself to one
            example, namely the theorem that non-orientable closed surfaces do
            not embed in three-dimensional space. One of the principal results
            of Chapter 9, a version of Lefschetz duality, certainly generalizes,
            but for an effective presentation such a gener- ization needs
            cohomology theory. Apart from a brief mention in connexion with
            Kirchhoff's laws for an electrical network I do not use any
            cohomology here. Thirdly there are a number of digressions, whose
            purpose is rather to illuminate the central argument from a slight
            dis tance, than to contribute materially to its exposition.

            This book reviews recent results on low-dimensional quantum field
            theories and their connection with quantum group theory and the
            theory of braided, balanced tensor categories. It presents detailed,
            mathematically precise introductions to these subjects and then
            continues with new results. Among the main results are a detailed
            analysis of the representation theory of U (sl ), for q a primitive
            root of unity, and a semi-simple quotient thereof, a classfication
            of braided tensor categories generated by an object of q-dimension
            less than two, and an application of these results to the theory of
            sectors in algebraic quantum field theory. This clarifies the notion
            of "quantized symmetries" in quantum fieldtheory. The reader is
            expected to be familiar with basic notions and resultsin algebra.
            The book is intended for research mathematicians, mathematical
            physicists and graduate students.

            proofs of results, sacrificing generalities and limiting the scope
            of the material in order to do so. The text is organized in four
            parts: strategic games, extensive games with perfect information,
            extensive games with imperfect information, and coalitional games.
            It includes over 100 exercises.

            A first course in linear algebra for mathematics, engineering and
            computer science students. Praised over many editions for its
            expository style and clarity of presentation, the revision of this
            best-selling text combines linear algebra theory with applications,
            and addresses a new generation of students' changing needs. . This
            text can be used in a first or second year 1- or 2- semester course.

            standard deviation is a criminal offense in six states, then you
            need The Cartoon Guide to Statistics to put you on the road to
            statistical literacy. The Cartoon Guide to Statistics covers all the

            probability in gambling and medicine, random variables, Bernoulli
            Trails, the Central Limit Theorem, hypothesis testing, confidence
            interval estimation, and much more&mdash;all explained in simple,
            clear, and yes, funny illustrations. Never again will you order the
            Poisson Distribution in a French restaurant!

            This text carefully explicates the concepts of introductory
            statistics for students in various majors, retaining the clear,
            straightforward and intuitive style that distinguished previous
            editions. Enhanced and updated, this edition provides still more
            realistic problems and applications, addresses some of the recent
            technological advances that are making their mark in the classroom,
            and displays sensitivity to some of the tenets of the ASA/MAA

            Computers have revolutionized what can be done in statistics and how
            it can be done, but introductory statistics textbooks have not
            always kept pace. Maximizing the potential of a computer-enriched,
            introductory statistics course by acknowledging what the computer
            can do, Goodman has discarded outdated tables and procedures,
            introduced when it was assumed calculation could only be done by pen
            and calculator. Enhancing the content and presentation of
            traditional methods, Goodman offers a fresh, experiential
            introduction to statistical concepts and calculations, while
            providing new possibilities for statistical exploration and
            experience. The goal of Modern Statistics is to take full advantage
            of the computer resources now available to students of statistics,
            fully integrating the coverage of the statistics curriculum with the
            related coverage of relevant statistical software. Goodman has thus
            created a modern approach to statistical methods -- an approach that
            encourages and promotes critical thinking in the application and
            interpretation of modern statistical techniques.

            This book is intended for the Mathematical Olympiad students who
            wish to prepare for the study of inequalities, a topic now of
            frequent use at various levels of mathematical competitions. In this
            volume we present both classic inequalities and the more useful
            inequalities for confronting and solving optimization problems. An
            important part of this book deals with geometric inequalities and
            this fact makes a big difference with respect to most of the books
            that deal with this topic in the mathematical olympiad. The book has
            been organized in four chapters which have each of them a different
            character. Chapter 1 is dedicated to present basic inequalities.
            Most of them are numerical inequalities generally lacking any
            geometric meaning. However, where it is possible to provide a
            geometric interpretation, we include it as we go along. We emphasize
            the importance of some of these inequalities, such as the inequality
            between the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean, the
            Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the rearrangementinequality, the Jensen
            inequality, the Muirhead theorem, among others. For all these,
            besides giving the proof, we present several examples that show how
            to use them in mathematical olympiad problems. We also emphasize how
            the substitution strategy is used to deduce several inequalities.

            General Relativity: An Introduction for Physicists provides a clear
            mathematical introduction to Einstein's theory of general
            relativity. It presents a wide range of applications of the theory,
            concentrating on its physical consequences. After reviewing the
            basic concepts, the authors present a clear and intuitive discussion
            of the mathematical background, including the necessary tools of
            tensor calculus and differential geometry. These tools are then used
            to develop the topic of special relativity and to discuss
            electromagnetism in Minkowski spacetime. Gravitation as spacetime
            curvature is then introduced and the field equations of general
            relativity derived. After applying the theory to a wide range of
            physical situations, the book concludes with a brief discussion of
            classical field theory and the derivation of general relativity from
            a variational principle. Written for advanced undergraduate and
            graduate students, this approachable textbook contains over 300
            exercises to illuminate and extend the discussion in the text.

            This book consists of three parts, rather different in level and
            purpose. The first part was originally written for quantum chemists.
            It describes the correspondence, due to Frobenius, between linear
            representations and characters. The second part is a course given in
            1966 to second-year students of l&rsquo;Ecole Normale. It completes
            in a certain sense the first part. The third part is an introduction
            to Brauer Theory.

            Reaction Engineering Problems The fourth edition of Elements of
            Chemical Reaction Engineering is a completely revised version of the
            worldwide best-selling book. It combines authoritative coverage of
            the principles of chemical reaction engineering with an unsurpassed
            focus on critical thinking and creative problem solving, employing
            open-ended questions and stressing the Socratic method. Clear and
            superbly organized, it integrates text, visuals, and computer
            simulations to help readers solve even the most challenging problems
            through reasoning, rather than by memorizing equations. Thorough
            coverage of the fundamentals of chemical reaction engineering forms
            the backbone of this trusted text. To enhance the transfer of core
            skills to real-life settings, three styles of problems are included
            for each subject Straightforward problems that reinforce the
            material Problems that allow students to explore the issues and look
            for optimum solutions Open-ended problems that encourage students to
            practice creative problem-solving skills H. Scott Fogler has updated
            his classic text to provide even more coverage of bioreactions,
            industrial chemistry with real reactors and reactions, and an even
            broader range of applications, along with the newest digital
            techniques, such as FEMLAB. The fourth edition of Elements of

            This textbook covers all the standard introductory topics in
            classical mechanics, including Newton's laws, oscillations, energy,
            momentum, angular momentum, planetary motion, and special
            relativity. It also explores more advanced topics, such as normal
            modes, the Lagrangian method, gyroscopic motion, fictitious forces,
            4-vectors, and general relativity. It contains more than 250
            problems with detailed solutions so students can easily check their
            understanding of the topic. There are also over 350 unworked
            exercises which are ideal for homework assignments. Password
            protected solutions are available to instructors at
            www.cambridge.org/9780521876223. The vast number of problems alone
            makes it an ideal supplementary text for all levels of undergraduate
            physics courses in classical mechanics. Remarks are scattered
            throughout the text, discussing issues that are often glossed over
            in other textbooks, and it is thoroughly illustrated with more than
            600 figures to help demonstrate key concepts.

            This is the only book that teaches all aspects of modern
            mathematical modeling and that is specifically designed to introduce
            undergraduate students to problem solving in the context of biology.
            Included is an integrated package of theoretical modeling and
            analysis tools, computational modeling techniques, and parameter
            estimation and model validation methods, with a focus on integrating
            analytical and computational tools in the modeling of biological
            processes. Divided into three parts, it covers basic analytical
            modeling techniques; introduces computational tools used in the
            modeling of biological problems; and includes various problems from
            epidemiology, ecology, and physiology. All chapters include
            realistic biological examples, including many exercises related to
            biological questions. In addition, 25 open-ended research projects
            are provided, suitable for students. An accompanying Web site
            contains solutions and a tutorial for the implementation of the
            computational modeling techniques. Calculations can be done in
            modern computing languages such as Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB?.

            This introductory undergraduate text provides a detailed
            introduction to the key analytical techniques of classical
            mechanics, one of the cornerstones of physics. It deals with all the
            important subjects encountered in an undergraduate course and
            thoroughly prepares the reader for further study at graduate level.
            The authors set out the fundamentals of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
            mechanics early in the book and go on to cover such topics as linear
            oscillators, planetary orbits, rigid-body motion, small vibrations,
            nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and special relativity. A special feature
            is the inclusion of many "e-mail questions," which are intended to
            facilitate dialogue between the student and instructor. It includes
            many worked examples, and there are 250 homework exercises to help
            students gain confidence and proficiency in problem-solving. It is
            an ideal textbook for undergraduate courses in classical mechanics,
            and provides a sound foundation for graduate study.

            A rigorous, yet accessible, introduction to partial differential
            equations&mdash;updated in a valuable new edition Beginning Partial
            Differential Equations, Second Edition provides a comprehensive
            introduction to partial differential equations (PDEs) with a special
            focus on the significance of characteristics, solutions by Fourier
            series, integrals and transforms, properties and physical
            interpretations of solutions, and a transition to the modern
            function space approach to PDEs. With its breadth of coverage, this
            new edition continues to present a broad introduction to the field,
            while also addressing more specialized topics and applications.
            Maintaining the hallmarks of the previous edition, the book begins
            with first-order linear and quasi-linear PDEs and the role of
            characteristics in the existence and uniqueness of solutions.
            Canonical forms are discussed for the linear second-order equation,
            along with the Cauchy problem, existence and uniqueness of
            solutions, and characteristics as carriers of discontinuities in
            solutions. Fourier series, integrals, and transforms are followed by
            their rigorous application to wave and diffusion equations as well
            as to Dirichlet and Neumann problems. In addition, solutions are
            viewed through physical interpretations of PDEs. The book concludes
            with a transition to more advanced topics, including the proof of an
            existence theorem for the Dirichlet problem and an introduction to
            distributions. Additional features of the Second Edition include
            solutions by both general eigenfunction expansions and numerical
            methods. Explicit solutions of Burger's equation, the telegraph
            equation (with an asymptotic analysis of the solution), and
            Poisson's equation are provided. A historical sketch of the field of
            PDEs and an extensive section with solutions to selected problems
            are also included. Beginning Partial Differential Equations, Second
            Edition is an excellent book for advanced undergraduate- and
            beginning graduate-level courses in mathematics, science, and
            engineering.

            Friedrich Nietzsche was an influential German philosopher whose
            works have been considered a source of inspiration for writers in
            the fields of psychology, philosophy, theology and literature.
            Beyond Good and Evil is an attempt by the renowned scholar to depict
            the frailty of the moral concepts adhered by the old philosophers.
            Through this groundbreaking work, Nietzsche inspires the
            philosophers of the future to be men of experiments. He advises them
            to celebrate the creative aspect of truth that appeals to the self
            and become critics rather than skeptics. The book is divided into 9
            sections that include 296 aphorisms. Written in a critical and witty
            style, the novel throws light upon the diverse aspects of the modern
            world that include religion, morality, free spirit, power of the
            will, virtues and nobility.

            Many lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples: no greater power did
            Zarathustra find on earth than the creations of the loving ones-- "
            good" and " bad" are their names.' After spending a decade in a cave
            on the mountains, the prophet Zarathustra comes down and begins
            talking to people. He believes that God is dead, and preaches about
            the Superman who has surpassed the notions of good and evil and
            embraced the idea of eternal recurrence. Reflecting on the
            Nietzschean philosophy, Zarathustra's sermons and discourses expound
            the concepts of will to power, the &Uuml; bermensch (Superman),
            eternal return, radical perspectivism, problem of nihilism, and
            individualism among others. One of the most influential and popular
            works of Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra was an inspiration for
            many. Intense and insightful, this philosophical novel remains a
            literary masterpiece."

            lifelong affair sparked and snuffed and sparked again by the forces
            that careen their fates along. How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia
            is a striking slice of contemporary life at a time of crushing
            upheaval. Romantic without being sentimental, political without
            being didactic, and spiritual without being religious, it brings an
            unflinching gaze to the violence and hope it depicts. And it creates
            two unforgettable characters who find moments of transcendent
            intimacy in the midst of shattering change.

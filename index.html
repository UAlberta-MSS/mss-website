      <p>
        The University of Alberta Mathematical Sciences Society provides a
        welcoming, safe, and inclusive space for students of all areas of study
        to explore their interests, pursue their passions, and collaborate with
        their peers. Members of the math society are encouraged to think
        creatively about math and explore topics outside the scope of
        undergraduate coursework.
